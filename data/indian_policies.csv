We will be open to talking about our funding sources, but please don’t ask us how and where we are spending the money. Much like traditional parties, we also won’t know but we definitely will be the world’s first unicorn government.', 'Startups have cool names, why shouldn’t our cities have that too? Since there are so many breweries in Bangalore, we’ll rename it to Brewgalore. Mumbai and Chennai, of course, will become Mumb.ai and Chenn.ai. Unconfirmed sources have told us that there are numerous Dell outlets in Delhi, which is why we’ll rename it to DellKart. After this, we’ll just start skipping vowels, replacing i’s with y’s, etc. to better startup-ize our cities.

Every LS and RS session will be planned in fortnightly sprints, the sessions will be streamed on the party’s own channel called NAPflix and of course, the Parliament will have ping pong  and foosball tables to allow our ministers to stay fit and energized.', 'Citizens can review cabinets on Glassdoor', 'If you’d like to tell us what we’re doing, you can review us on Glassdoor! The Non Aadmi Party aims to be an open and transparent government, which is why there will be no need to open a Glassdoor account to look at all Glassdoor reviews -- they will be open for all. If, like startup founders and product managers, our ministers also reply to everything that Naval tweets, you can go ahead and give them negative reviews on Glassdoor.', 'With changing times, the traditional definitions of crime have also changed, and we’ve decided to update them. Calling yourself a “sapiosexual” and “only here for friends” on Tinder, or sending good morning messages on WhatsApp, or calling your blog “Random Musings”, or adding “Writer” to your Twitter bio should all be unlawful activities.

We love clouds so much that we'll make them omnipresent in our skies. We'll get rid of firewalls and data centres and move all your data to the clouds. More clouds will also mean more rain for our farmers, and will also mean the citizens will be protected from harmful UV rays. Safety, security and kheti-badi, all in one."", 'Communication is important. A government should reach out to the citizens more often and hear what they have to say. Instead of a radio speech (which is hardly the way to reach Millenials), the Non Aadmi Party will host a Town Hall meeting every Sunday.

And there will be pizza!', 'Startups in India have been affected by the infamous Angel Tax regulation, which imposes taxation on VC investments in unlisted companies. However, with our superior intelligence, we will out-general this regulation by allowing VC funding via electoral bonds. This will not only allow all investments to be tax-free, but also allow all donations to be completely anonymous!*\n* - In doing so, we expect we will be just the start of a long line of startups attempting to get into politics once everyone realizes its potential for tax-free investments. But this government has first mover advantage!', 'Better planning, better tracking, Jira for all!', 'Older, dated government 5-year-plans will be replaced with the Non Aadmi Party’s own Startup Sprint Plan. Our new quarter planning scheme will be Vision 2025, and to help us achieve our goals, we shall define public OKRs for all senior government positions. As you would expect, their adherence to these OKRs will affect their appraisals during review cycles, determined via extensive anonymous peer review. Who needs NITI Aayog when you’ve got a national-level Scrum Master?', 'If there’s one thing the Non Aadmi Party is great at, it’s using technology to solve problems you never even knew existed.

Get ready to look beyond CryptoCows, and move on to ROIRhinos, HODLHaathis, Royal Bengal TigerTokens, and of course, Blackbucks.', 'Finally, what kind of startup would we really be if we didn’t intend on someday going public? Get in on the craze now, as every member of the voting public who pledges their vote to NAP will be entitled to a percentage of ownership of the country. What’s that you say? How can a country be owned via stocks? Well, let’s just say that if war ever breaks out and territories of India have to be seceded acquired, you’re in for a huge buyback!', 'Be an informed voter this elections', 'We need your help to support the #MeraVoteMeraDesh campaign for the Lok Elections and State Assembly Elections in 2019.
